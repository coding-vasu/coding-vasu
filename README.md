- 🌱 Currently leveling up my skills in React
- 💡 Always on the lookout for the next big tech challenge

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

```javascript
const mySkills = ['JavaScript', 'React', 'Node.js', 'HTML', 'CSS'];  // Add or modify as needed

## 🎯 Goals for 2024

- [ ] Build a machine learning model that can predict my coffee intake based on my commit frequency.
- [ ] Create a VR experience that simulates what it feels like to finally fix that bug you've been staring at for hours.
- [ ] Learn Rust, because apparently, I enjoy questioning my life choices.
- [ ] Contribute to open-source projects without accidentally breaking the entire codebase.
- [ ] Achieve a perfect work-life balance. (Ha! Who am I kidding? But it's good to have dreams, right?)


## ⚡ Fun Fact
My code is like my coffee - strong, complex, and occasionally keeping me up all night.
